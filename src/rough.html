					<h3>The Three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </h3>
			
            		<p>
						Irish households produce approximately 1.5 million tonnes of waste each year. Nearly half of this rubbish is general waste, 
						which is collected from black bins and goes to landfill. Only a quarter of this waste is collected from our green and brown bins 
						to be recycled or composted.

											Avoiding the production of waste is the greatest method to reduce it. 
											Use items again whenever possible. For instance, use a reusable bottle and 
											fill it up at home or at a water fountain to avoid purchasing plastic water bottles. 
											Bring your own reusable shopping bags if you're going shopping.
											<br>
											Here are some tips to reduce your waste:
										<ol type="1">
											<li>Shop smarter by buying frozen goods which will keep longer</li>
											<li>Use shopping apps such as ToGoodToGo which help battle food wastage</li>
											<li>Purchase a BPA free plastic bottle or a metal bottle to avoid reusing and wasting plastic</li>
											<li>Instead of binning clothes, bring them to a charity shop</li>
											<li>Don't leave lights and other appliances on unnecessarily</li>
										</ol>
										These tips will go a long way to reducing waste, and saving the environment, as well as your pocket!

											You can "reuse" materials in their original form instead of throwing them away,

											man's trash is another man's treasure!

											Here are some tips to reuse your waste:
										<ol type="1">
											<li>Use reusable goods such as coffee cups and water bottles</li>
											<li>Make wise packaging decisions around how much you buy</li>
											<li>Instead of binning leftovers, freeze them, or keep them for the next day</li>
											<li>Take up upcycling as a hobby to reuse depreciated household items</li>
											<li>Take broken items to a local hardware store, they may have some use for them</li>

							Clean Eyre was my Final Year Project which I completed
							in 2021. This project aimed to help people reduce their
							carbon footprint by offering guidance and offering people
							a chance to see where they were at with their Current
							tendancies. This is a more dynamic web application
							compared to the project in 2021.
