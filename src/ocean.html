                            31% of the earth's land surface is covered by forests. By cleansing the water and air and creating jobs, 
                            for instance, they assist people in thriving and surviving. Approximately 13.2 million people worldwide work in 
                            the forest sector, and an additional 41 million have jobs that are related to it.

                            In addition, many creatures depend on woods. More than 75 percent of all land-based life inhabits forests. 
                            Because they serve as a carbon sink, forests are essential for preventing climate change because they absorb carbon 
                            dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and contribute to a continuing change in weather patterns.

                            Agriculture is the primary driver of deforestation (although poorly designed infrastructure is also becoming a significant hazard), and illegal logging 
                            is the primary driver of forest degradation. The tropics lost trees at a rate of almost 30 soccer fields per minute in 2019.

						<p>
							Clean Eyre was my Final Year Project which I completed
							in 2021. This project aimed to help people reduce their
							carbon footprint by offering guidance and offering people
							a chance to see where they were at with their Current
							tendancies. This is a more dynamic web application
							compared to the project in 2021.
